## Shakespeare's Sonnets

Shakespeare's 154 sonnets were published in 1609 as a collection titled Shake-speares Sonnets. Written mostly in the 1590s, they are among the greatest achievements in English poetry. Unlike many earlier sonnet sequences that idealized distant, unattainable love, Shakespeare's are deeply personal, exploring complex emotions: passionate admiration, jealousy, betrayal, the passage of time, mortality, lust, and the power of poetry itself to defeat death.


The sonnets are divided into two main sequences:

- Sonnets 1–126: Addressed to a beautiful young man (the "Fair Youth"), often interpreted as a nobleman or patron. These range from urging him to have children, to profound declarations of love, to reflections on time and art.

- Sonnets 127–152: Addressed to (or about) the "Dark Lady," a mysterious woman of dark hair and complexion, exploring intense sexual desire, infidelity, and self-loathing.

- Sonnets 153–154: A brief mythological coda about Cupid and incurable love.

The poems use the Shakespearean sonnet form (three quatrains and a couplet, rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG) and are written in iambic pentameter. Their emotional depth, psychological insight, and linguistic brilliance make them timeless.
